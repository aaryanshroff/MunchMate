1181|4|Food and atmosphere is nice. As one should expect in the CBD. Sometimes the back room can be stuffy on a busy day. I recommend the raw oysters and burgers. A few dollars on the high side for lunch.|2018-09-25 16:54:39
1536|5|Amazing! Late night arrival in NOLA so got amazing service from Gary! Food was amazing. Highly recommend the seafood platter! Highest quality and freshness...|2017-12-16 01:20:58
78|4|We have been here twice for brunch and have enjoyed it immensely. Everything we have tried has been delicious, particularly the grits with scallions and sour cream. But the room is always freezing so be sure to bring a sweater!|2016-03-07 17:25:30
857|4|We stopped by a couple of weeks ago for Sunday brunch.  The food was very good and filling.  Nice drinks, and we had a very pleasant server.  Cool cafe space.  Overall a good recommend.|2016-02-23 18:52:16
1691|5|My fiancé and I stopped by for a quick eat before a conference. We let out waiter know this, and he really delivered on the service. We split the shrimp and grits and pancakes for a late breakfast. Not only did our waiter bring the food out quickly, it was split into two separate dishes nicely. And it was the best shrimp and grits we've had! Overall a great experience.|2015-10-08 00:08:19
675|4|Great oyster happy hours that go on from 5-7pm! My boyfriend and I shared a dozen oysters and a glass of champagne. Our tab was $24 with tip. Great value! I hear they have the best to-go cups in town, and we totally missed out on that. The staff were very nice and attentive. We almost felt too casual but we felt at home! I'd definitely go back :)|2015-08-19 18:35:37
889|5|Expensive but great service & food. The ribeye melted in my mouth. The burger was huge & delicious w/ every bite. The bread pudding is everything it's hyped up to be. Definitely go at least once & share some meals w/ friends.|2015-07-03 20:39:26
1566|4|Great happy hour. Perfectly shucked oysters. Seriously, not one grity sea booger and I've ate here countless times. I am huge liver pate enthusiast. Luke has the best I've ever had. I usually go for  oysters, pate, and a few drinks so I can't comment on the entrees. Service is wildly inconsistent. On one occasion it was truly terrible. The manager noticed without us complaining and comped several drinks and dessert.|2015-06-08 19:22:01
1625|4|Every one raves about the oysters for Happy Hour, but check out the Daily Lunch specials.     You get a choice of app or soup and a fixed daily entrée.   Always a good bite at lunch time and you don't always need a reservation.|2015-06-08 18:40:30

The service was excellent, the facilities were very nice and I was fairly impressed with catering. Great spot for conferences or small conventions. Close to the airpor with a complimentary shuttle and complimentary parking.|2011-07-28 13:00:24
518|Ichicoro Ane|190|5|Ichicoro Ane gets lots of things right and the best part about it is the combination of the ambiance with the food choices and whiskey selection. I'm very happy with this location and the servers I have encountered so far have been helpful and pleasant.

The katsu is great and I highly recommend it to people looking for a more filling dish on the menu. The bao buns were also good for a lighter fish. I haven't had anything I really regretted trying, but definitely ask your server about the portion sizes of each dish since they vary across the menu.

The cocktail selection is excellent. I even had a special Japanese Old Fashioned last time which was a little expensive, but well worth it for some quality Japanese whiskey. 

I'm looking forward to exploring the menu little by little. The best way to experience this is in a group setting so you can try more things and it really reminds me of Izakayas or Japanese pubs I visited in Japan and Korea.|2018-02-23 22:49:01|nnImk681KaRqUVHlSfZjGQ|Carlos|
1010|Barrio Brewing|455|3|I cannot comment on the food as I had only a couple beers. I did have the white IPA and a red ale which were good but not blow me away. I might be spoiled having 2 friends who brew professionally but the beers were good, not outstanding. The location is kind of far from other stuff which normally wouldn't bother me but everything around is seriously industrial and scenery does make a better place. They do discount the beer $1 when a train comes by and maybe that's the best they can make of a meh location. Probably give it more like a 3.5 stars. It does say something that there was a loyal following at 4pm on a Sunday.|2014-04-01 05:30:09|dZpGKP00UuG4b5P9aOVDYQ|Jack|
4010|China Kitchen|1434|5|This was my first time here. I was very pleasantly surprised by how good the food is. I had not seen any Yelp reviews but saw some other reviews. People swore this was the best Chinese food they have had outside of major cities like Manhattan. They were right. While I was eating a guy came in and said to the clerk that they have the best Sweet and Sour soup. I will have to try that now. I had the beef chow mein. It was the best I have had at any Chinese restaurant!!! The beef was nice and tender. My meal came with fried rice (no pork) and tasted great. Very friendly family folk working there. I will come again next time I am in the mood for good Chinese food!!!!!|2014-04-01 04:09:36|ScuWOAFGiCSDkZPI4x5mAQ|Mitch|
